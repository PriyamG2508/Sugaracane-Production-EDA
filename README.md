# Sugarcane Production EDA

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global sugarcane production. The analysis was performed using Python and various data science libraries in a Jupyter notebook hosted on Google Colab. The goal is to uncover trends, insights, and patterns in sugarcane production across different countries and time periods.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore sugarcane production data to:

- Analyze global sugarcane production over time.
- Identify key sugarcane-producing countries.
- Understand the trends and seasonal patterns in production.
- Visualize the data through informative charts and graphs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries used for data visualization.
- **Google Colab**: The Jupyter Notebook environment was used to run the project.

## Key Insights

- Detailed analysis of sugarcane production trends.
- Insights into top-producing countries.
- Data visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of the fluctuations and patterns in production.

## Project Structure

- `Sugarcane_Production_project.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook file containing the full EDA.
- `list_of_Countires_by_Sugarcane_production.csv`: The dataset file used in the project (replace it with the actual file name if it is different).
- `README.md`: This file that provides an overview of the project.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sugarcane-production-eda.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook `Sugarcane_Production_project.ipynb` in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.

3. Ensure that the dataset `list_of_Countires_by_Sugarcane_production.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook or adjust the file path in the notebook code accordingly.

4. Run the cells to explore the data analysis and visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset `list_of_Countires_by_Sugarcane_production.csv` contains global sugarcane production data from various countries. [https://github.com/sakshisinghal936/EDA-Sugarcane-/blob/main/List%20of%20Countries%20by%20Sugarcane%20Production.csv.]
